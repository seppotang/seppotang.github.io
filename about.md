Hi! My name is Michael Graves.

I want to offer you technology driven solutions for your small business and home residence.

I bring most of my youth's experience building computers networks, software, and a passion for electronics. I believe
in bringing these experiences to my clients and delivering quality, time-sensitive solutions.

When I'm not working, you'll find me practicing Japanese, traveling, and playing guitar.
